# aws-disaster-recovery

a simple [scriptable] command line interface to make disaster recovery simple and automated with amazon web services (AWS)

project description
==========================
the initial scope for this project will be to automate image creation for instances within an AWS account.  

Support for not imaging an instance should be provided by checking for a tag on an instance designating that the instance should not be automatically imaged.

The roadmap includes developing functionality to also automate the restore process as there are many moving parts to this in practice but the initial scope will be automating backups first.
